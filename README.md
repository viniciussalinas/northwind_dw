### Overview
This repository contains the code for a data warehouse project developed during the Analytics Engineer course at Indicium Academy. The project aims to create a data warehouse using dbt and involves data from the "erp_northwind" source.

### Data Transformation
The code included in this repository performs data transformation by selecting specific columns and generating a new dataset from the "public_customers" table. The transformed data is materialized into a table for further analysis and reporting.

### Using the starter project

Try running the following commands:
- dbt run
- dbt test
